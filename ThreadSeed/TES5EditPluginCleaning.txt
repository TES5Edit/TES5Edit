[size=4][color=#00BFFF]TES5Edit Plugin Cleaning Emporium[/color][/size]

Time to grab a cup of coffee. I prefer a custom blend myself with Cinnamon, Chocolate, Vanilla and anything with the word cream in it like Butterscotch Cream. Bring up your favorite music, light a fire (if you have a fireplace), get comfy in your favorite chair, and clean some Skyrim plugins. With the release the of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url] begins the continued saga started by ElminsterAU. Previous versions of FO3Edit (Fallout 3), FNVEdit (Fallout: New Vegas), and TES4Edit (Oblivion) have given us endless hours of gaming enjoyment.

Now if you have no idea what I am talking about then you are in the right place. While everyone is discussing whether or not to sort Form Lists, and DIAL INFO information this thread will be a place you can post your plugin cleaning questions and get feedback from others like you that have never heard of cleaning plugins and have no idea why you need to be doing that.
