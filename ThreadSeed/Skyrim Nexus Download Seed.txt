(make sure to install it after unpacking it)

[color=#FF0000]With each new version of TES5Edit our cleaning routines become more accurate.  Because of this it's very important to restore the original Bethesda master files and the originals of the plugins you use and reclean them.[/color]

[color=#FF0000]NOTE Changes to Merged Patch: 3.0.24 of TES5Edit only adds Containers and Leveled Lists to Merged Patches.[/color]

- [TES5] Fixed event name definition in QUST
- [TES5] CELL water level fixup for better conflicts detection
- [TES5] Autoremoving legacy RNAMs from WRLD; empty keywords from NPC_, ARMO, AMMO, WEAP, ALCH, MISC
- [TES5] Removed NPC_, ARMO, AMMO, WEAP records from Merged Patch (unsafe to copy possible scripts to a new plugin)
- [FO3] No sorting of DIAL groups
- [FO3/FNV] Fixed record definition for ragdolls which crashed game after cleaning several DLCs
- Copy "Compare to" selected file to the game's data folder if it is not there

[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.0.23 contains the following changes:[/color]

- [TES5] Merged patch updated for Skyrim, currently it merges:
  * Leveled NPCs, Items, Spells
  * NPC: Items, Spells, Head Parts, Factions
  * Race: Hairs, Eyes, Spells
  * Containers
  * Relations
  * Form Lists
  * Keywords on: Armor, Weapon, Ammo, NPC
- [TES5/FNV/FO3] When performing UDR there will be a warning message for deleted NavMeshes.
- [TES5] Updated record definitions.
  * BPDT was sorted by a localized name which is inconsistent for different languages (now sorted by a node name)
  * NPC's tints are now sorted by tint index for better conflicts detection
  * QUST aliases are no longer sorted by index
  * QUST stages are now sorted by stage index
  * Improved NavMeshes (thanks to Divstator)
- [TES5] FaceFX phonemes where empty after copying RACE record.
- [TES5] Fixed bugs when copying RACE and QUST (empty model was created for RACE; QUST location aliases were turning into ref ones).
- [TES5] Create start-enabled quests sequence SEQ file (you can select several files at once).
- [TES5] Improved error checking.
- [FNV] CHAL record was missing some challenge types from Dead Money DLC.
- [FNV] Disabled DIAL sorting, was causing errors when copying INFO records.
- No autosaves when "you know what you are doing".
- Compare with external tool option in Edit window.
- "Apply Filter for Cleaning" menu. Note that xEdit saves filter settings when you press OK button in filter window, so if you clean plugin and exit the program, your filter settings will be preserved.
- Filter option for deleted records.
- Saving messages to [TES5/FNV/FO3/TES4]Edit_log.txt upon exit.
- Fixed minor bug when Edit can't find game's folder. If your registry settings is invalid due to a Steam bug and Edit is unable to find your game, put it in the game's root folder where the game executable file is (Oblivion.exe, TESV.exe, etc).
- Reason: The game's Registry entry is missing. This happens to a lot of people, because Steam likes to remove it whenever the game is updated or its game cache is verified. Run the game's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.
