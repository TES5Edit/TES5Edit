[size="5"][b][color="#FF0000"]NOTE: This post is about the actual version of FNVEdit, FO3Edit, and TES4Edit, and soon TES5Edit by ElminsterAU.  If he is willing, he can compile it himself with his original code once the necessary changes are made.[/color][/size][/b]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Summary:[/color][/size][/b] I am putting together a list of potential bugs in FNVEdit and FO3Edit.  If its not a bug in the program but rather it's the record structure that isn't defined properly, FNVDump or FO3Dump can be used to further decode the records.  I can not provide any troubleshooting nor can I fix any bugs with the source code.  FNVEdit as it is, has proprietary dependencies and the full source can not be compiled without them.

Any bugs with the FNV Engine itself will be brought up after TES5Edit is complete since they will be present in TES5Edit as well.  Unfortunatly I can't promise a fix since he has a serious lack of spare time for this, but I'd still like to compile a list for possible review at a later date.

Please post anything related to FVNEdit in this thread and not the TES5Edit thread as I can't make any changes at this time.  Also state the issue and specific supporting facts.

Does anyone have knowledge of known bugs in FNVedit, or any others. Basically the file name makes the version. So once TES5Edit is compiled, if you rename it to FNVEdit it would work for Fallout NV. I ask because any bugs in a previous version will be present in TES5edit and I'd like to get them into the repository once its created.

Nice to see that someone is picking up the ball on this wonderful utility. 

These are the bugs that  I know about in FNVEdit:

1. Weapon mod references placed in the editor, report an error when checking for errors. This wouldn't be so bad, but these records can't be injected into a master when merging a plugin, because it errors.

2. A terminal reference, that is used in a script, also generates an error during an error check, and the script can't be injected when merging your plugin to a master for a big project.

3. The most serious bug is one with packages. Certain sub-records are stripped off when saving the plugin with FNVEdit. The one I have been impacted with the most is the 'Trigger Location' of dialog packages. This is the PLD2 subrecord. You can imagine trying to build quest mods with dozens of dialog packages that get broken every time you save the plugin. With the trigger location stripped off, an actor that has low level processing will cross the worldspace in order to force greet you. Right now, the work-around for me is to use version 3.0.15. But that has problems with some of the DLCs, and some performance issues when the tree is expanded.

Others are also having serious issues the package records, and there's more detail here. It's not just the dialog packages:

[quote name='Dandys']
Some of my mod partners and I have identified a problem in a package subrecord that is ruining Dialogue, Eat, Use Weapon, and Ambush packages and costing us a large amount of work that has to be redone every time we update the mod.

We don't know the underlying cause, but this is what happens. In packages, there is the "Locations" subrecord that has "PLDT - Location 1" and "PLDT - Location 2" in it. However, down in the record, the subrecord "PLD2 - Location 2 (again??)" comes up. What we have found is that FNVedit deletes the "PLD2 - Location 2 (again??)" subrecord and moves what was in it to the "PLDT - Location 2" part of the "Locations" subrecord. That is actually not what is supposed to happen, we think, as packages that use a second location with the data in that place act as if they have no second location.

We have found that if we manually move the contents of "PLDT - Location 2" to "PLD2 - Location 2 (again??)" and then remove "PLDT - Location 2" and save, the packages work properly. However, if that mod file is then edited in any way and saved again, FNVedit seems to try to "fix" the packages that in fact we fixed, and moves "PLD2 - Location 2 (again??)" to "PLDT - Location 2" again, breaking the packages.

If FNVedit could be changed to realize that "PLD2 - Location 2 (again??)" is the real, correct place for Location 2 data and save it there every time, a lot of time would be saved.

Is anyone capable of editing FNVedit to fix this bug?[/quote][/quote]

The 'Trigger Location' of dialog packages are PLD2 subrecords. Build quest mods with dozens of dialog packages get broken every time you save the plugin. With the trigger location stripped off, an actor that has low level processing will cross the worldspace in order to force greet you. Right now, the work-around is to use version 3.0.15.

Manually moveing the contents of "PLDT - Location 2" to "PLD2 - Location 2 (again??)" and then remove "PLDT - Location 2" and saveing, the packages work properly.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="3"]4. [/color][/size]Formlists are sorted by FNVedit (on edit/record merge?). This breaks ammo lists at times and some mods depend on formlist order. 
can't manualy edit formlist order to correct this as formlist order is displayed sorted and no options to change order.
This means geck is required to edit/sort formlists. 

(If an ammo formlist has an ammo with a projectile record as the first record, all ammos without a projectile record do not fire correctly)
