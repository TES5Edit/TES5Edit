TES4 is the header record for the mod file. It contains info like author, description, file type, and masters list.
* Flags indicate whether a file is a master (Flags & 1) or plugin, regardless of what the file extension says.
* Flags also indicate whether a file has [[Tes5Mod:String_Table_File_Format|localized string tables]] (Flags & 128). If this flag is not set, lstrings are treated as zstrings.
