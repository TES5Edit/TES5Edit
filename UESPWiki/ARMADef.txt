ARMA records contain armature data, which is how armor (or similar) is displayed on a model.  These also contain information on bare (ie unarmored) models, presumably combined with specific armor/addons.  For creatures, this can be potentially only 1 record.

Each record has the potential for gender-separated models, as well as 1st person vs. 3rd person and also a list of races that this qualifies for.

If MOD3 is not present, MOD2 is both genders, if MOD3 is present then MOD2 is only male.
If MOD4 is not present, MOD2/3 are all viewpoints, if MOD4 is present, then MOD2/3 are specifically 3rd person while 4/5 are 1st person.

A similar distinction exists with NAM0-3 (base texture) eg NAM0 = male, 3rd person, NAM2 = male, 1st person

Note: there are some with only MOD2/4 or MOD3/5 for gender-specific models as well (eg Astrid)
