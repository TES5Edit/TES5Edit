Those updating the wiki can navagate to this page and click on one of the records.

For this example I'm going to use MISC since it isn't really formated properly and contains the same information you will recieve in a ticket from one of the decoders. To get started click the edit tab.

For what our project is doing we only need to use the 'edit' tab at the top.  All the changes are shown under the history tab.

Copy the text from the white text box to an editor of choice.  I suggest Notepad++ with the Aspell dictionary plugin installed.

Save the information to a txt file in the USEPWiki folder for our SVN.  Chose the nameof the record, followed by Def.   For the above example I called it MISCDef.txt.

The text isn't formatted in this example which is why I chose it.  The information you are going to recieve from the decoders is going to be formatted in a simular way.  The first time I tried to edit a record I chose to just cut and paste from other records to start with and then start making changes.

I chose to cut and paste the formatting from the DOOR record for now but I need to make changes.

After you make corrections to the fields should start to reflect the values of the actual record you are submiting to the wiki.  In this case I am editing the MISC record.

When you are done you can priview your changes before subbmitting them.


The last thing to do is cut and paste the text you   

==Groups==

GRUPs are collections of [[#Records|records]], and are used to improve scanning of files to make it easier to skip over records that the reading program is not interested in. In addition to this, subgroups for WRLD and CELLS provide some useful structural information (e.g., the division of cell data into persistent and non-persistent references.)

===Top Groups===

In Skyrim.esm, the top, or highest level groups are stored in the following order:

:GMST, KYWD, LCRT, AACT, TXST, GLOB, CLAS, FACT, HDPT, HAIR, EYES, RACE, SOUN, ASPC, MGEF, SCPT, LTEX, ENCH, SPEL, SCRL, ACTI, TACT, ARMO, BOOK, CONT, DOOR, INGR, LIGH, MISC, APPA, STAT, SCOL, MSTT, PWAT, GRAS,  TREE, CLDC, FLOR, FURN, WEAP, AMMO, NPC_, LVLN, KEYM, ALCH, IDLM, COBJ, PROJ, HAZD, SLGM, LVLI, WTHR, CLMT, SPGD, RFCT, REGN, NAVI, CELL, WRLD, DIAL, QUST, IDLE, PACK, CSTY, LSCR, LVSP, ANIO, WATR, EFSH, EXPL,  DEBR, IMGS, IMAD, FLST, PERK, BPTD, ADDN, AVIF, CAMS, CPTH, VTYP, MATT, IPCT, IPDS, ARMA, ECZN, LCTN, MESG, RGDL, DOBJ, LGTM, MUSC, FSTP, FSTS, SMBN, SMQN, SMEN, DLBR, MUST, DLVW, WOOP, SHOU, EQUP, RELA, SCEN, ASTP, OTFT, ARTO, MATO, MOVT, ''HAZD'', SNDR, DUAL, SNCT, SOPM, COLL, CLFM, REVB

Whether the game engine expects this order is unknown, but it's probably safer to use this order than not.

All top groups contain records matching their label (e.g., the GMST top group contains GMST records). For most top groups, ''only'' the matching record types are present. However, in the CELL, WRLD and DIAL top groups, each main record can be followed by one or more child groups which contain additional records of a different type. Unlike Oblivion, WRLD groups in Skyrim no longer contain ROAD records.

The following groups are only found in subgroups of other records:
:REFR, ACHR, NAVM, PGRE, PHZD, LAND, INFO

Notes:
*6 record types have a GRUP but have no records:[[Tes5Mod:Mod File Format/CLDC|CLDC]], [[Tes5Mod:Mod File Format/HAIR|HAIR]], RGDL, SCPT, SCOL, PWAT.  
*There are 2 HAZD groups, the second one has no records.
