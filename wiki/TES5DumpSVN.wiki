#summary Records covered in current TES5Dump-SVN

= Introduction =

In order to assure accuracy of TES5Edit I'm releasing complied versions of TES5Dump.  It will not correctly decode all of Skyrim Records.  The records that have been roughly decoded will be listed below.

= Current TES5Dump-SVN =

TES5Dump-SVN108.exe

You can make a small plugin in the CK to use with TES5Dump.  Use the following Syntax:

<code>TES5Dump "Your Plugin.esp" > "Your Plugin.txt" 2> "Dumplog.txt"</code>

You can also use Update.esm or Skyrim.esm to look for anything that might have been missed.  The example would dump only the COBJ record.

<code>TES5Dump -dg:COBJ "Skyrim.esm" > "TES5Skyrim.txt" 2> "Dumplog.txt"</code>

The Dumplog.txt will capture the console messages.  You can review it for errors.

Bytes 29 and 30 seem to be decoded correctly until you look at a texture for an NPC_ or interior.
