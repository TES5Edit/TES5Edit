Changelog

0.8	rewritten remove unseen faces code to be more effetive
	changed IgnoreTranslation= to be a mesh mask, e.g. to ignore all use just use .nif
	added NotHDMeshMask= requires UseHDFlag=true, matching meshes are not HD, overwrites flag from derived from column #2, overwritten by texture masks
	added IsHDMeshMask= requires UseHDFlag=true, matching meshes are HD, overwrites NotHDMeshMask, overwritten by texture masks

0.7	append to log file instead of overwriting
	added FO3 mode, same as FNV
	added FNV mode
	added BSShaderPPLightingProperty
	updated nitristrips
	fixed points to triangles conversion
	added NotHDTextureMask= matching textures are not HD, overwrites flag from derived from column #2
        added IsHDTextureMask= matching textures are HD, overwrites any other method
	new export file switches [default value]:
		GameMode=[TES5]/FNV
		DontMergeShapes=true/[false]
		DontGenerateVertexColors=true/[false]
		RemoveUnseenFaces=true/[false]
		IgnoreWater=true/[false] [FNV no effect]
		IgnoreMaterial=true/[false]
		DontFixTangents=true/[false]
		DontGenerateTangents=true/[false]
		UseHDFlag=[true]/false [FNV no effect] (0x00020000 in column #2)
		GlobalScale=[1.0]

0.6	fixed cell origin of LOD objects causing some LOD models to show/not show
	fixed use of world offset so filenames for reading BTR and writing BTO match
	fixed tangents and bitangents not being adjusted for LOD object rotation
	optimized remove unseen faces to also remove unseen vertices, vertex colors, normal, tangents and bitangents data for smaller file size
	remove HD flag and vertex color in LOD level 8/16 to match CK
	added support for additional material shaders Snow/Ash
	added support for SLSF2_Double_Sided flag
	lessened log output, added --verbose command line parameter to show all log messages
	added console error message for missing input file or data directory
	added stop error message for missing LOD nif 
	added stop error message if logfile cant be written to
	added verbose error message for missing landscape BTR, continues without removing unseen faces for quad
	added uv remapping for atlas textures
	added tolerance value for uv remapping
	added BSA archive reading for LOD meshes and landscape BTR, so no need to unpack them first
        atlas texture or 'lod' in texture name HD will be unset. All other textures set HD. --useHDLOD to use HD flag (2nd column) from input file to set HD on non atlassed textures with 'lod' in name
	moved a cmd line directory arguments to input file
	updated input file format to accept parameters in the form of parameter=value
	added IgnoreTranslation as a workaround for certain problematic vanilla meshes
	read input file with current codepage
0.5	Last release by Ehamloptiran
